### [DynamicProgramming](DynamicProgramming) :moneybag:
Calculate differences amongst exchange rates for foreign currencies. 

### [averageFromFile](averageFromFile) :memo: 
Compute the average from a file and write this value to an output file.

### [BarberShop](BarberShop.cpp) :barber:
Use multithread programming to solve the classic sleeping barber problem.
